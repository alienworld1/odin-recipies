    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Swedish Meatballs are a Christmas tradition! It's worth the effort and is <em>even</em> better the next day! You can also reserve brown gravy and add sour cream for the leftovers.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 slices day-old white bread, crumpled</li>
        <li>½ cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon butter</li>
        <li>1 small onion, minced</li>
        <li>⅔ pound ground beef</li>
        <li>⅓ pound finely ground pork</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar (Optional)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground allspice</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon ground ginger (Optional)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>¼ cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or as needed</li>
        <li>2 cups beef broth, or as needed</li>
        <li>½ (8 ounce) container sour cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place bread crumbs into a small bowl; mix in cream. Allow to stand until crumbs absorb cream, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, melt 1 teaspoon butter in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion until light brown, about 10 minutes. Transfer onion to a mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>Mix ground beef, ground pork, egg, brown sugar, salt, black pepper, nutmeg, allspice, and ginger with onion in the mixing bowl. Lightly mix in bread crumbs and cream.</li>
        <li>Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Pinch off about 1 1/2 tablespoon meat mixture per meatball; form into balls. Place meatballs into the skillet and cook, turning often, until browned, about 5 minutes. Insides of meatballs will still be pink.</li>
        <li>Place browned meatballs into a baking dish, pour in chicken broth, and cover with foil.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until meatballs are tender, about 40 minutes. Remove meatballs to a serving dish.</li>
        <li>Pour pan drippings into a saucepan over medium heat. Whisk flour into drippings until smooth.</li>
        <li>Gradually whisk in enough beef broth to total about 2 1/2 cups liquid.</li>
        <li>Bring gravy to a simmer, whisking constantly, until thickened, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Just before serving, whisk in sour cream. Season with salt and black pepper. Serve gravy with meatballs.</li>
    </ol>
